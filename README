A Mezzo sample project
======================

Because building Mezzo projects can be a little tricky, this is a very basic
project that shows how to use Ocamlbuild as well as the new plugin-tag option.

That way, you just need one invocation of `ocamlbuild`, and everything will be
taken care of: calling the `mezzo` compiler to convert `mz` files into `ml`
files, compiling the resulting `mz` files while linking them with the
already-compiled mezzo standard library and mezzo runtime library.

This requires a properly-installed `mezzo` -- we recommend you use OPAM to
install it.

Happy hacking!
